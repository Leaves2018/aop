# Assignment Oriented Programming

## Visual Studio Code
That's where the dream starts. Almost all the configurations/operations mentioned in this article require and on top of VS Code.

Just go to [VS Code Official Website](https://code.visualstudio.com/), download the installer, click next on each page.

## WSL2
If you have latest Windows 10 or 11, you only need to enter
```powershell
wsl --install
```
in your `Windows PowerShell`.

For details, just follow the official document [Set up a WSL development environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment), which is really easy to follow.

<!-- How to uninstall wsl2: https://pureinfotech.com/uninstall-wsl2-windows-10/ -->

## LaTeX
Of course you can use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) especially when you need to collaborate with someone who may not be willing to toss themselves to try the content mentioned in this article.

However, there does exist some benefits for building a local LaTeX environment.
* First, you do not need network connection for writing in LaTeX.
* Second, when your assignment involves some images/plots output from code, it is quite common that you may replace old flawed ones with newly correct ones. A local LaTeX environment will automatically recompile without your effort to upload to Ovealeaf again. 
* Third, it is actually not that hard to install a local LaTeX environment.


For `macOS`, download `MacTeX` from [The MacTeX-2021 Distribution](https://tug.org/mactex/).

For other sysmtems, download `TeX Live` from [TeX Live availability](https://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire.html). Fow `Windows`, you can use the `install-tl-windows.exe` installer, but I would recommend to install WSL2 and install Tex Live in Linux.

### Install Tex Live on Linux

Download and unpack the installer:
```shell
wget https://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl-unx.tar.gz
tar -zxvf install-tl-unx.tar.gz
```
Start the installation:
```shell
cd install-tl-unx
sudo perl install-tl
[... messages omitted ...]
Enter command: i
```

Then you need to add the directory of Tex Live binaries to your path:
```
echo 'PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2021/bin/x86_64-linux:$PATH' > ~/.bashrc
```

### Configure LaTeX for VS Code
Open Ubuntu terminal, Change to your home directory, and use `code` command to start VS Code:
```
cd
mkdir new_project && cd new_project
code .
```
Open VS Code and click the fifth button `Extensions` or enter `Ctrl + Shift + X`. Search `LaTeX` and download `LaTeX Workshop`.

Then I would like to suggest you to create a directory for your report. For example, create a directory `report`.
Then create a file `report.tex`, and copy-paste the following content:
```latex
\documentclass[a4paper,12pt]{article}
\begin{document}
\title{Assignment Title}
\author{Your Name (Your ID)}
\maketitle
\tableofcontents
\section{Introduction}
\section{Conclusion}
\end{document}
```
Enter `Ctrl + S` to save the file, and you will find that a few files generated. Do not  delete them, but the only one you need to know is the one with suffix of `.pdf` like `report.pdf`. Open it, and then use VS Code's split view to put the `.tex` left side and `.pdf` right side. Now you would have nearly same experience as Overleaf. Everytime you save the `.tex` file, it will compile a new `.pdf` automatically.

Note: If you meet errors like:
```
This is BibTeX, Version 0.99d (MiKTeX 2.9) The top-level auxiliary file: Thesis.aux 
I found no \citation commands---while reading file Thesis.aux 
I found no \bibdata command---while reading file Thesis.aux 
I found no \bibstyle command---while reading file Thesis.aux 
(There were 3 error messages)
```
 You may need to change `"latex-workshop.latex.recipes"` to the following. To make the change, open `File->Perferences->Settings` in VS Code, search `latex-workshop.latex.recipes` and click _*Edit in settings.json*_.

]
```
### Suggestions LaTeX packages
#### Add code 
You can use `minted`.
```
pip install Pygments
```
## Programming Language

### Python
First check if your computer already has `Python` installed:
```shell
python3 --version
```
It should output something like: `Python 3.8.12`. If you do have `Python` installed already, then you may want to read [Miniconda](#miniconda) next.

If not, then one of the easiest way to install Python is through [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/). Just click the `Downloads` button, wait for the downloading and then run the installer.

However, if you are using `Windows` and want to install `Python` in `WSL2`, you might consider some other ways. For example, if you are using `Ubuntu`, you can install `Python` by opening your terminal and enter:
```shell
sudo apt install python
```

#### Miniconda
After that, I would recommend you install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), with which you can create multiple independent virtual environments and manage different packages you might use in different projects.

Go to [miniconda's website](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and download the appropriate version. For example, for `WSL2 Linux`, enter:
```shell
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py38_4.11.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
Then execute the shell scripts:
```shell
sh Miniconda3-py38_4.11.0-Linux-x86_64.sh -b
```
Next, initialize the shell for `conda`:
```shell
~/miniconda3/bin/conda init
```

Note: If you are using `macOS` and `zsh`, you may need replace `~/miniconda3/bin/conda init` by `~/miniconda3/bin/conda init zsh`.

#### Jupyter Notebook in VS Code
Open your `VS Code`, click the fifth button `Extensions` or enter `Ctrl + Shift + X`, search `Jupyter` and install the first three extensions from `Microsoft`: `Jupyter`, `Jupyter Keymap`, `Jupyter Notebook Renderers`. Also search and install `Python` extension.

Then create a new file with a suffix of `.ipynb`, for example, `playground.ipynb`.
Open this file and follow instructions from `VS Code`, like installing a ipynb kernel.
Then choose a kernel corresponding to your Python version. Most of the time, the suggested version would be fine. However, it seems like Ubuntu gives you Python but not pip, so you might choose the Python version installed by conda, which works fine.
### C++
If you have successfully installed `WSL2`, you should already have `gcc`. Then for using `C++` in `VS Code` I would recommend you to read [Using C++ on Linux in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-linux) or [Using Clang in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-clang-mac).

Here I would like to introduce how to write `C++` in Jupyter Notebook within VS Code, just like `Python`.
#### Install `xeus-cling`
We first follow [xeus-cling's official installation guide](https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus-cling).

Install `mamba` via `conda`:
```shell
conda install mamba -n base -c conda-forge
```

Use `mamba` to create a new virtual environment for `cling`:
```shell
mamba create -n cling
source activate cling
```

Install `xeus-cling` and its dependencies within the new virtual environment `cling`:
```shell
mamba install xeus-cling -c conda-forge
```

#### Configure for VS Code
Activate `cling` virtual environment and install missing Jupyter related dependencies:
```shell
conda activate cling
mamba install notebook jupyterlab ipywidgets  -c conda-forge
```
> I am not quite sure whether we need all the three packages. 

Use `code` command to open your project. For example, you could create a `playground` directory as your project directory.
```shell
mkdir playground
code playground
```
Use VS Code GUI to create a file with `.ipynb` suffix, for example, `playground.ipynb`.
Open the file, switch the kernel to `C++14` (or one of the other two). Create a new code block 

and now enjoy the interactive C++ programming!

## `aop-start`: A starting point for each assignment

### `gh`: GitHub CLI
If you use Ubuntu (like WSL2 Ubuntu), enter the following code in Ubuntu terminal to install `gh`:
```
curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gh
```
### Git branch
Here are some very basic commands that you may need to collaborate using git branch and GitHub.
#### Create a new branch
You can create a new branch locally and then push it to GitHub.
```shell
git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]
git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

Then you need to login in with your GitHub account. Enter:
```
gh auth login
```
and follow the instructions.

Update your git to latest version first.
```
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:git-core/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git -y
```

Set your git username and email.
```
git config --global user.name "test"
git config --global user.email "test@test.com"
```

Initialize a git repository.
```
git init
```
#### Get update from main branch
```shell
git checkout [name_of_your_new_branch]
git merge origin/main
git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

> In [this link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3876977/update-git-branches-from-master), you may learn more about how to get update from `main` branch.

#### Merge your branch to main branch
```shell
git checkout main # Switch to the main branch
git merge [name_of_your_branch] # Merge your branch to the main branch
git push # Push the local merge to remote repository (like GitHub)
```

> You may refer to [this link](https://gist.github.com/nanusdad/7e516743e5e709073f7e) for more information about how to use branch.
